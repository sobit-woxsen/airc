The sun rises over the red soil of Maharashtra, painting the landscape in golden hues. For generations, farmers here have watched the skies, praying for the right amount of rain at the right time. But today, something has changed. In fields across the state, a quiet revolution is taking place—one that's giving farmers new hope and new tools to face an uncertain climate. At the heart of this transformation is not just a government program but also a dynamic academic-industry partnership: Woxsen University, along with the Nosh Technologies Centre of Excellence for Agri Tech and Sustainability.

## When Tradition Meets Innovation

Ramesh Patil, a third-generation farmer from Pune district, has long followed ancestral methods of cultivation. But now, thanks to Krishi Samruddhi Yojana and the support of Woxsen University in collaboration with Nosh Technologies Centre of Excellence for Agri Tech and Sustainability, he's part of a new era of agriculture—data-driven, climate-resilient, and economically sustainable.

"Earlier, we used to plant the same crops our fathers did," Ramesh shares. "Now, with support from the Centre of Excellence and Woxsen's experts, we understand what our soil and climate actually need."

## The Heart of the Change

The Krishi Samruddhi Yojana is more than a government scheme; it is a bold initiative built on research, innovation, and community partnership. Woxsen University, through the School of Business, in collaboration with Nosh Technologies, UK, has launched the Nosh Technologies Centre of Excellence for Agri Tech and Sustainability, represented by Mr. Somdip Dey and Dr. Hemachandran, to support and accelerate this transformation by providing:

- **Scientific and Technical Expertise:** Leveraging cutting-edge research in sustainable agriculture and precision farming.
- **Capacity Building:** Through field-based student programs, workshops, and farmer training initiatives.
- **Technology Integration:** With strengths in AI, IoT, and data analytics, the Centre introduces tools that enable predictive insights, optimize resource use, and enhance yield quality.

## Where Academia Meets the Fields

Woxsen University and the Centre of Excellence are actively embedding students and faculty in farming communities across Maharashtra. Dr. Hemachandran, academic representative from Woxsen and a leader in agri-tech integration, explains: "Our goal is to ensure that innovation is rooted in practicality. We co-develop solutions with farmers, using research that is relevant, accessible, and sustainable."

## Stories from the Ground

In Nashik, grape farmer Sunita Deshmukh credits precision farming modules from the Centre for increasing her yield while reducing water use. "The students and experts introduced me to drip systems and soil sensors. Now, my grapes are healthier—and my costs are lower."

In Aurangabad, cotton farmer Vikram Jadhav adopted organic techniques developed with the Centre's support. "The professors and experts didn't just advise—they helped us implement ideas that really work."

## The Ripple Effect: Empowering Rural India

The impact goes beyond individual farms. With Rural Innovation Hubs powered by the Centre of Excellence, farmers are accessing shared infrastructure, mentoring, and business development support. Women are starting agri-enterprises, and youth are returning to agriculture with confidence and purpose.

These hubs act as live demonstration models—combining traditional wisdom with advanced agri-tech innovations.

## Looking Ahead: Scalable, Sustainable, and Smart

As climate change threatens agricultural viability, the Nosh Technologies Centre of Excellence for Agri Tech and Sustainability, in collaboration with Woxsen University's School of Business, is setting a benchmark for interdisciplinary, scalable, and sustainable impact.

Representatives Mr. Somdip Dey and Dr. Hemachandran bring in global expertise from Nosh Technologies, UK, ensuring that Maharashtra's agri-revolution benefits from international best practices and cutting-edge research.

"Today, when I look at my fields, I don't just see crops," says Ramesh Patil. "I see a future—one made possible by new ideas, global collaboration, and real support."
